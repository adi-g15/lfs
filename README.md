## Linux From Scratch

Linux From Scratch is an awesome book, thanks to the community for maintaining it.

Read/Download from https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/

Agar aap pehli baar LFS system build kar rahe ho to, don't use the automatic scripts except the downloader script. Build it yourself, it will be worth the time üòÅ

> Note: @adi isme scripts the, lekin ab uska kaam nhi hoga, to sirf notes hi rahega ab isme (bcz, there is already a project named "Automated LFS")

### Scripts

* `smart_download.sh` - The LFS book has list of packages, their hashes and download url, just copy that part to a `lfs_package.txt` file, and run the script, that's it, you may change the download location by modifying the `source_directory` variable in the script

Thanks to all the maintainers of LFS ‚ù£
